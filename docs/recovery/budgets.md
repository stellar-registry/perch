# Recovery resource budgets

**Status: stub.** This file lists what must be measured before the pool's
release depth is chosen ([`spec.md`](spec.md) §14, D15), and the rule that
chooses it. Workstream 2 fills in the measurements against the release
circuit, adapter, verifier, pool, controller, and account. Every cell
marked *TBD* is unmeasured. Do not read a number into it.

## Reference points (not release measurements)

From Nido's `docs/recovery/stage3-measurements.md`. These are a prior
circuit at depth 24 with an arity-15 `auth_hash`, measured on a high-end
desktop:

| Metric | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `verify_proof` CPU instructions (constructorless UltraHonk verifier, real Wasm metering) | 179 257 831 |
| Network per-transaction instruction limit at that time (protocol 27) | 400 000 000 |
| `bb prove` wall time, Apple M5 Max | ~68 ms |
| Proof size / VK size / public inputs | 6 976 B / 1 888 B / 96 B |

Every full-transaction cost, fee, browser number, and mobile number was
left unmeasured there.

## What to record with every measurement

- Commit, toolchain versions (nargo, bb or bb.js, soroban-sdk,
  stellar-cli), and the circuit's `circuit_id`.
- The network's resource limits at measurement time, read from the
  network's config settings. Budgets below are fractions of those limits,
  not absolute numbers, so a limit change moves the threshold with it.
- The device (model, OS, browser and version, RAM) for client-side numbers.

## 1. Proving (client)

Per depth `D ∈ {24, 32}`, for one proof of any action. All actions share one
circuit.

| Workload | Reference device | Metric | D = 24 | D = 32 | Proposed budget |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Witness fetch (indexer to path) | — | latency p95 | TBD | TBD | ≤ 2 s |
| Witness generation | browser, mid-range phone | time p95 | TBD | TBD | ≤ 2 s |
| Proof generation, bb.js in the browser | mid-range phone (named in results) | time p95 | TBD | TBD | ≤ 30 s |
| Proof generation, bb.js in the browser | mid-range phone | peak memory | TBD | TBD | ≤ 1 GiB |
| Proof generation, bb.js in the browser | mid-range laptop | time p95 | TBD | TBD | ≤ 10 s |
| Proof generation, native `bb` | mid-range laptop | time p95 | TBD | TBD | ≤ 5 s |
| Artifacts the client downloads (circuit, CRS slice, prover Wasm) | — | bytes | TBD | TBD | ≤ 50 MiB |
| Proof size | — | bytes | TBD | TBD | fits the transaction-size budget below |

## 2. Full transactions (on-chain)

Each row is the complete transaction, simulated and then submitted against
the release Wasm on testnet under enforcing authorization (no mocked auth,
no mock verifier). Each records CPU instructions, memory bytes, ledger
read/write entries and bytes, transaction size, event bytes, resource fee,
and inclusion latency.

| Transaction | Worst case to measure | Instructions | Memory | Read/write bytes | Tx size | Fee | Latency |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Enroll ZK through `apply_doc` (compile, `rcv_sync` wiring checks, `rcv_insert`) | insertion that seals a tree and opens the next | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| `begin_lost_key` (includes `derive_target`) | largest supported document | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| `begin_compromise` (includes `derive_target` over the baseline) | largest supported document | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| `publish_baseline` | largest supported document | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| `submit_guardian` | promoting approval under `Protected` (includes `rcv_gate`) | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| `submit_zk` (adapter, verifier, root check, nullifier) | promoting proof, `Combined` | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| Completion `apply_doc` (recovery rule) | `Combined`, ZK rotation (pool insert), a pre-recovery document and a target both at the document caps with every slot differing (spec §7.5), every removed credential revoked | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| Completion after rule churn | the row above, after many prior ordinary applies of a maximum-size document; must not grow with the number of past applies (#102 review, P1) | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| Cancellation | `Combined` (both factors in the last transaction) | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| `approve_change` | one guardian, `Reconfigure` or `Upgrade` | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| `submit_zk_change` (adapter, verifier, root check) | `Reconfigure` or `Upgrade` | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| `Protected` reconfiguration `apply_doc` | `Combined`: reading the recorded quorum and proof, a new enrollment insert, documents at the caps | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| `Protected` `schedule_upgrade` | `Combined`, reading recorded approvals | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| `execute_upgrade` (includes the `rcv_upgrade` epoch bump) | — | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| `begin_*` after an attacker opened many collecting attempts | promotion with `invalidate_below` (must not grow with the number of siblings) | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD | TBD |
| Ordinary authorization overhead | `__check_auth` reading the freeze mirror and checking reserved names, versus plain `do_check_auth` | TBD | TBD | — | — | TBD | — |

**Proposed budget for every row:** at most 75% of the network's
per-transaction limit for instructions, memory, read bytes, write bytes,
and transaction size. The headroom covers authorization growth (more
guardians) and network limit changes. The document caps (spec §7.5) are
then set to the largest values for which the completion and reconfiguration
rows stay within budget.

## 3. End-to-end latency

| Flow | Measured from → to | Proposed budget |
| --- | --- | --- |
| ZK lost-key recovery | the user starts recovery → the attempt is authorized (witness fetch, prove, begin, submit) | ≤ 2 min p95 on the mid-range phone |
| Guardian approval | a guardian opens the request → their approval is included | ≤ 1 min p95, excluding human time |
| Completion | timelock elapsed → target installed | ≤ 1 min p95 |

## 4. Storage and rent

| Item | Per | Metric |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Controller state | account | entries, bytes, rent per year at maximum TTL |
| Revoked set | account | bytes per revoked credential |
| Nullifier records | credential | bytes, rent |
| Pool frontier | active tree | bytes, rent |
| Root → tree entry | insertion | bytes, rent (paid by the inserter) |
| Recorded change approval | guardian or proof | bytes, rent |
| `renew` / `renew_tree` | call | fee |

## 5. Depth decision rule

1. Measure §1 and §2 at both `D = 32` and `D = 24`, with the release circuit
   and contracts, recording §"What to record".
2. **Choose 32** if every §1 and §2 row at `D = 32` is within its budget.
3. Otherwise **choose 24** if every row at `D = 24` is within its budget.
   Record which `D = 32` rows failed and by how much.
4. Otherwise **no depth is releasable.** Stop and revisit the circuit, the
   adapter, or the transaction shapes. Do not relax a budget to make a depth
   pass without recording the change here and having it reviewed.
5. Rollover is required at either depth (§14.2); this rule never removes it.

The proposed budgets above are proposals. Reviewers confirm or replace them
before §5 runs, and the confirmed values are recorded here.

## Results

Workstream 2's measurements and the rule's application are in
[`docs/zk/measurements.md`](../zk/measurements.md) (2026-10-03, protocol
29 limits; the measured circuits' `circuit_id`s are in its generated
"Circuit identities" table). In summary:

- §1: native and single-threaded bb.js proving take 0.07 s and 0.66 s on a
  desktop at D = 32. Client artifacts are 8.4 MB and the proof is 14.6 KB.
  The reference phone and laptop are not yet measured.
- §2, ZK components only: adapter `verify` is 96.9M instructions and 5.1 MB
  at D = 32 (94.9M at D = 24); `rcv_insert` sealing a tree is 43.8M
  instructions and 2.2 KB written (34.8M at D = 24). The full-transaction
  rows are the controller workstream's.
- §5: every measured row is within budget at D = 32, so **D = 32**,
  provisional on the open rows above. D = 24 stays buildable as the
  fallback.
